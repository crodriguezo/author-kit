Human label is very expensive, error-prone and time-consuming process.
Learning with less labels is a challenging and important problem in machine learning.
Teaching linear classifiers with a few labeled examples usually overfits. 
Thus, a set of augmentations are used to generate more samples.
In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate augmentations in the embedding space.
Given a labeled image, 
we generate a set of image representations using multiple encoders.
Those representations are projected and aligned in a unified space.
Thus, we can effectively generate multiple measurements for a given image 
and use them as augmentations in the embedding space.
Through extensive experiments, we show that our augmentations 
are more effective and safer than make transformations on the input image.
